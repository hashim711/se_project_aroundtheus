**Intro**

This project is a gallery for beautiful places to explore around the United States.

**Project Features**  
Project was created from Figma design. It has different features such as edit, add and like buttons. This was created by using Grid property and has room for more images to be added later. Hover states changes the state of the object by using stroke property. In the future, I will add Fill property to SVG images by using JavaScript since it didn't work through HTML and CSS.
